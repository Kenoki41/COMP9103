Insurance company
You will be designing a GUI application for the  insurance company application we did last week.

In week 10, we have designed a text-based menu system to handle the following functionalities.

Add a new insurance policy for a client

Lodge a claim against a policy

Display details of all policies

However now we need to be able to handle these functionalities using a GUI application. You are required to come up with a design to handle these functionalities in any way you like. But keep in mind we always looking for a user friendly design.
